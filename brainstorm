BEST POSSIBLE MOVE SCENARIOS:
1. get the last marble from your move into your mancala to go again  (+3)
    (-if player 1, sabotage player 2's first move as well (this may just work if the algorithm correctly sabotages and doesn't need to be hardcoded))
2. get the last marble into an empty space on your side (steal) (+2)
3. sabotage optimal opponent move (run first 2 steps, determine if any pit on our side has enough marbles to get in that spot, and sabotage) (+1)
5. move marble on the rightmost side (default action) (0)
